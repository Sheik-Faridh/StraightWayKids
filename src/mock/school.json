		"objective": "The Straight Way Kids School firmly believes that by educating our children in a balanced way in both government curriculum and Islamic studies they will grow up to be good Muslims who will thereby automatically become good citizens and part of the solution, not part of the problem. <br /> <br /> Prophet Muhammad (SAW) stated that “No father can give his child anything better than good manners”. <br /> <br /> The Islamic Studies subjects include: Islamic Akhlaq (Manners), Tawheed, Aqeedah, Fiqh (Essentials and Practices), Qur’an reading / recitation and Hifz (memorization), Islamic History, and basic Arabic. <br /> <br /> Islamic studies are also integrated with other subjects such as Science and Mathematics. Everything we teach in the classroom can be linked to Islam. <br /> <br /> Primary Students enrolled at Al-Hidayah Islamic School do not need extra lessons in religion at an after school or weekend ‘Madrasah’; the School provides quality Islamic education which sufficiently covers the requirements for their age group during the normal school day.",
